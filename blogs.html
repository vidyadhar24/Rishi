                <h3>Why I'm Intelligent</h3>
                <h5 class="date">Posted by Rishi; 25th July,2020.</h5>
                <p>The answer is this: You have to learn a lot and keep practicing. This helps in keeping the mind occupied all the time.The challenges that you think are harder,
                    no longer seem the same when you keep practicing. When you have a Sibling who is just average or above average in studies, you have to teach her/him a lot.
                    That is when you learn. To prove my Intelligence, take this: someone worked day and night to get 10/10 in 10th exams. But me! I didn't even write the exam and
                    they granted 10/10.I often think myself what would happen,had I appeared in the exams ..? Do not mind all this..These are all Intelligent person's issues.
                    you guys just carry on with your routine, sub-average life.. that's Ok!! Hi I...U

                <h3>Why you are more than what you are</h3>
                <h5 class="date">Posted by Rishi; 26th July,2020.</h5>
                <p> What do you think about you? are you strong or are you weak? what ever it is..the point is: Never conclude. You think you are strong, but actully, you 
                    might be much stronger than You think about you. If you think you are weak..Then you are not thinking right. Because everyone has their own battels to win 
                    and dreams to chase. To fight the battle or to pursue a dream, it takes a lot. If you have that in you, You are already a Hero.!!
